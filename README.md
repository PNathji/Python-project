Parkinson's Disease Detection:
This repository contains a machine learning project developed to detect Parkinson's disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The project leverages Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
Overview:
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project aims to build a predictive model to detect Parkinson's disease from patient data using machine learning techniques.
